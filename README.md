# pendulum-stubs

Unofficial stubs for the [pendulum](https://github.com/sdispater/pendulum) library.

**Note 1:** This repo is meant to be *temporary* and will almost certainly be deleted once
https://github.com/sdispater/pendulum/pull/320 lands.

I created this repo mostly as a stop-gap for some of my own personal projects, not because
I expect it will be broadly useful to the community as a large.


**Note 2:** The vast majority of this repo is based on type hints already present in
the [pendulum repo](https://github.com/sdispater/pendulum) plus the work already
done in https://github.com/sdispater/pendulum/pull/320 lands.

My only contribution was to run stubgen and make some low-effort patches to
silence some of the noise and bugs in the output.
